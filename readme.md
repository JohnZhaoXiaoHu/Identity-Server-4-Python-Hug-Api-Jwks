# Identity Server 4 samples: Clients Call Python Hug Api

I use hug as python api, [Hug](http://www.hug.rest/)  

You need to install theses python packages:  
hug, pyjwt, hug_middleware_cors, requests, cryptography  

Run Python Api, and the port should be 8000: Â  
`hug -f main.py`

The dotnetcore part of this solution is copied from identity server 4's official samples repository: [Quickstart 7](https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer4.Samples).
